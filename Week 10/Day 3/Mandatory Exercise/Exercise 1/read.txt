Usually when people ask how I’m doing, 
the real answer is I’m doing sh**ty,
but I can’t say I’m doing sh**ty because I don’t even have a good reason to be doing shitty. 
So if I say, “I’m doing sh**ty,” 
then they say, “Why? What’s wrong?”
And I have to be like, “I don’t know, all of it?” 
So instead, when people ask how I’m doing, I usually say, “I am doing so great.”
